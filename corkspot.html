                            <h2 style="color:red;">APPLE CORK SPOT!</h2>
                                        <h4 class="subheading">Apple cork spot is a physiological disorder that can affect apple quality and reduce visual appeal. Cork spot generally appears in the outer portion of the fruit flesh as small green dimples or depressions.</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">This disorder may begin developing in June and continue throughout the initial stages of growth and enlargement. The green spots eventually enlarge to corky, discolored areas 1/4 to 1/2 inch into the flesh of the apple. The corky spots may occur anywhere on the fruit flesh.

Fruit growers sometimes confuse this disorder with damage resulting from insects or pathological diseases, particularly those involving fungus infections or hail injury. </p>

                                        <h4 class="subheading">Although apples affected with this disorder are edible, the unattractive external appearance often arouses consumer concern and reduces salability of fruit. Cork spot commonly occurs on York Imperial and occasionally on Delicious and Golden Delicious.  Low soil pH, light crops and excessively vigorous shoot growth are associated with increased incidence of cork spot. .</h4>
                                        <p class="text-muted">The best long-term control for cork spot is the addition of agricultural ground limestone to the soil at planting, according to soil test recommendations. Limestone should be added at three to five year intervals after planting, based on soil tests. In addition to soil liming, calcium sprays may help to reduce the incidence of cork spot in established apple plantings, although they may not be effective in every situation.</p>

                                        <h4 class="subheading">In affected orchards, new infections can be reduced by removing leaf litter and trimmings containing infected tissue from the orchard and incinerating them.</h4>
                                        <p class="text-muted">This will reduce the amount of new ascospores released in the spring. Additionally, scab lesions on woody tissue can be excised from the tree if possible and similarly destroyed.</p>

<p>Chemical controls can include a variety of compounds. Benzimidazole fungicides, e.g., Benlate (now banned in many countries due to its containing the harmful chemical benzene) work well but resistance can arise quickly. A number of other chemical classes including sterol inhibitors such as Nova 40, and strobilurins such as Sovran are used extensively; however, some of these are slowly being phased out because of resistance problems.</p>

<p>Contact fungicides not prone to resistance, such as Captan, are viable choices. Potassium bicarbonate is an effective fungicide against apple scab, as well as powdery mildew, and is allowed for use in organic farming.[2][3][4][5] Copper and Bordeaux mixture are traditional controls but are less effective than chemical fungicides, and can cause russeting of the fruit. Wettable sulfur also provides some control. Timing of application and concentration varies between compounds.</p>
