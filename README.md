# E-Kisaan-seva
web app - E-kisaan seva aims to help distressed farmers by helping them identify the disease in their crop and providing them with preventive and treatment measures.


Idea Flow

Phases in the ideal information flow of the project:

Phase I

This phase directs the user to options where they can shortlist their crop on the basis of season, type of crop etc.

Phase II

This phase is the information phase where the user may match the diseased crop to the preexisting photos on the database and obtain all the preventions, cures and all the other relevant info or if they are not satisfied or are unable to get results then they move on to phase III where a provision for uploading a photo would be provided.

Phase III

User is required to upload a picture with ample lighting and a fairly good resolution in the website where the photo would be processed further in the cloud server as explained in phase IV.

 

Phase IV

After the photo has been uploaded gets compared to tens of thousands of photos in our dataset using machine learning and gives the required result and if still passed unidentified user would be given a provision to mail the picture where it may be manually identified.
                                    

Phase V 

The results are reverted back to the user where he/she may apply the recommended cure.
 
 The project includes the webapp and the deep learning model to predict crop-diseases.
