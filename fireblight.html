                                        <h4 class="subheading">Fire blight, also written fireblight, is a contagious disease affecting apples, pears, and some other members of the family Rosaceae. It is a serious concern to apple and pear producers. Under optimal conditions, it can destroy an entire orchard in a single growing season.</h4>
                        <p class="text-muted">The causal pathogen is Erwinia amylovora,[1] a Gram-negative bacterium in the family Enterobacteriaceae. Pears are the most susceptible, but apples, loquat, crabapples, quinces, hawthorn, cotoneaster, Pyracantha, raspberry and some other rosaceous plants are also vulnerable. The disease is believed to be indigenous to North America, from where it spread to most of the rest of the world.</p>

                                        <h4 class="subheading">Tissues affected by the symptoms of Erwinia amylovora include blossoms, fruits, shoots, and branches of apple (Pomoideae), pear, and many other rosaceous plants. All symptoms are above ground and are typically easy to recognize. Symptoms on blossoms include water soaking of the floral receptacle, ovary, and peduncles. This results in a dull, gray-green appearance at 1â€“2 weeks after petal fall, and eventually tissues will shrivel and turn black. </h4>
                                        <p class="text-muted"> The base of the blossom and young fruit show similar symptoms as infection spreads. Opaque white or amber colored droplets of bacterial ooze can be seen on the infected tissue when the environment is high in humidity. Shoots show similar symptoms but develop much more rapidly. </p>

                            <h4 style="color:red;">CONTROL.</h4>
                                        <h4 class="subheading">Spraying plants with streptomycin or injecting plants with oxytetracycline can prevent new infections. The widespread use of streptomycin spray has led to antibiotic resistance in some areas, such as California and Washington.</h4>
                                        <p class="text-muted">Certain biological controls consisting of beneficial bacteria or yeast can also prevent fire blight from infecting new trees. The only effective treatment for plants already infected is to prune off the affected branches and remove them from the area.</p>

<p>Plants or trees should be inspected routinely for the appearance of new infections. The rest of the plant can be saved if the blighted wood is removed before the infection spreads to the roots.[7] There is no known cure; prevention is the key.

E. amylovora needs to be destroyed externally, before it enters the cell. This is simply because once it enters the host, it spreads during the endophytic phase of pathogenesis. Once this happens external control methods become ineffective. The ideal control method is to apply copper and antibiotics to the plant externally. </p>

<p>This is the only effective method and it is indeed preventative. Currently it has been noted that E. amylovora has developed a resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin, as do most bacteria due to their flexible ability to transfer preferential genes promoting resistance to certain antibiotics horizontally from species not even similar to it as all bacteria can.</p>
